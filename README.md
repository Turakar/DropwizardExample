# DropwizardExample
A hello world server you can register yourself on. It is build with dropwizard and gradle.

### Building
Did you see this gradlew? Execute it with oneJar.
You have to have a PostgreSQL server up and running with a database called HelloWorld and a table called users. The table should have two columns, name and address. Both are varchar (choose a reasonably size yourself) and name is primary key. You also have to configure the connection using the hello-world.yml, only md5 is tested.

### Eclipse
Just import this project as a gradle project (File -> Import -> Gradle)

### Running
```java -jar DropwizardExample-standalone.jar server hello-world.yml```

### Usage
Everything happens on `/hello-world`. A normal GET gives you a "Hello Stranger!". If you specify the param name, it will greet you by name. If you do a POST with the data `name=yourname&address=Mr` it will save that and greet more gracefully on GETs.

### Curl examples:

```curl -i http://localhost:8080/hello-world```

```curl -i http://localhost:8080/hello-world?name=Foo```

```curl --data "name=Foo&address=Dr" http://localhost:8080/hello-world```
